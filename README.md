# ERS-Site
New Online Website named “ERS”, specialized in TVs, Tablets, and Laptop computer needs a brand new IT system where customers can add items into a shopping cart, check-out, and have the products deliver to their home.  They would need to store and manage the inventory along with customer information in a database, DB2 for z/OS. Transaction details should also be saved in the database tables so we can “mine” the customer behavior later. You are responsible to develop the database schemas/tables to store all the data and transactions.  You will need to design the website where customer do their shopping.  Use the SJSU main campus address as the warehouse.  You can calculate how long it takes to deliver that package (use Google Map services to get the driving time and distance).
